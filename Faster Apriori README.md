# Faster Apriori Implementation Guideline
This project also includes the implementation procedures for Faster Apriori.
The Faster Apriori algorithm consists of updatble table and probability-based pattern mining modules for enhancing its efficiency.
And this project includes all the utilized functions.

## Datasets
All the datasets evaluated for the Faster Apriori algorithm can be directly achieved through the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
Please go through below links to access the datasets:

- [Dataset-I Online Shop](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/clickstream+data+for+online+shopping)
- [Dataset-II Educational](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance) 
- [Dataset-III Health](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Z-Alizadeh+Sani)

## Procedures
1. Download the dataset and form it into .csv
2. Import all essential libraries and functions 
3. Transform the dataframe into an array with nested lists indicating each instance
4. Apply the Faster Apriori algorithm
5. Visualize the extracted rules
6. Calculate the exceptionality measure for each rule
7. Sort rules based on support, confidence, and CPIR 
8. Select final rules for interpretation.
